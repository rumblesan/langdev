# Building Trax

This blog aims to cover the steps I go through when creating a relatively simple language for live-coding acid bass lines.

It's going to be called **Trax**, and despite it being simple, there's going to be quite a few moving parts.

* A Parser
* An Interpreter
* A Sequencer/Scheduler
* A Synthesiser
* An Editor plug-in
